# Introduce to merodi-box

Melody box (ãƒ¡ãƒ­ãƒ‡ã‚£ãƒ¼ç®±ðŸŽ¶ in Japanese) is my hobby project, a desktop application written in Electron. It's idea is pretty simple: Providing an elegant way to organize and play your music library. With power of HTML and CSS, It will be easier to create more flexible and beautiful UI.

# Current development

It is in under construction. Everything is still very basic. More function will be coming soon. Feel free to explore the code ;)
